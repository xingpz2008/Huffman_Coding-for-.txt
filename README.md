# Huffman_Coding-for-.txt
To whom it may concern,

This is a class project for Algorithm and Data Structure.
The project is the realization of Huffman Coding, File compression and extraction involving stack, tree and queue.
Currently only .txt file with all A to Z and space appeared can be compressed. Extraction process requires special file format (for ref: output.xpz)

just enjoy.
